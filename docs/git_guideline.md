# Git Guideline

1. Use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) as branching model. For a more sophisticated release process use [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), just without a `develop` branch.
2. Commit messages should follow [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
3. The branch name consists of the issue ID and the issue title, e.g. `42_update_dependencies`.
