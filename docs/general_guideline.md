# General Guideline

1. Maintain a changelog using [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com)
2. Use *Semantic Versioning*, see [semver.org](https://semver.org)
3. Prefer open interfaces over closed or custom interfaces, e.g. OpenAPI.
4. Prefer well-known and matured projects (libraries, tools, ...) over fancy & new or custom projects.
5. Keep dependencies up-to-date, e.g. try to update as part of each feature or bugfix.
6. Prefer ecosystem native technologies, e.g. package and distribute python package via a wheel package and not as a debian package.
7. Prefer ecosystem native best practices and code styles, e.g. *CamalCase* in Java, but *snake_case* for Python methods.
